\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Consider the equation $t^2 = a$ written in fixed point form $t = F(t)$. It turns out that several $F(t)$ are possible:}
\begin{align*}
    F_1(t) &= 0.5(t + at^{-1}) \\
    F_2(t) &= at^{-1} \\
    F_3(t) &= 2t - at^{-1}.
\end{align*}
\textit{Verify that this is true and discuss the (non-)convergence behavior for the corresponding iteration $t_{n+1} = F(t_n), n \le 0$, for each of the three cases. If possible, determine the order of convergence.}
