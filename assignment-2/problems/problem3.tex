\section{Problem 3}
\textit{Looking at the system}
\begin{align*}
    2x_1 - x_2 + x_3 &= -1 \\
    2x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_3 &= 4 \\
    -x_1 - x_2 + 2x_3 &= -5
\end{align*}
\textit{and using the results from Problem 1(2), what can you say about applying the Jacobi iterative method
and the Gaussâ€“Seidel iterative method, both for initial value $x^{(0)} = (0, 0, 0)^T$?}

We start by writing this system in matrix form, $Ax = b$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
    2 & -1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 2 \\
    -1 & -1 & 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 \\ 4 \\ -5
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

The standard convergence condition for any iterative method is that the spectral radius of the iteration matrix is less than 1:
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(D^{-1}(L + U)) < 1
\end{equation*}
where $D$ is the diagonal of $A$, $L$ is the lower triangular matrix and $U$ is the upper triangular matrix of $A$.

Let $T_1$ be the matrix from Problem 1(2). Observe that $A = -2T_1 + 2I = 2(I - T_1)$. This is the same as saying 
\begin{align*}
    L + U &= -2T_1 \\
    D &= 2I  \Rightarrow  D^{-1} = I / 2\\
\end{align*}
We thus have 
\begin{align*}
    \rho(D^{-1}(L + U)) &= \rho(I/2 (-2T_1)) \\
    &= \rho(-T_1)
\end{align*}
As the spectral radius looks at the absolute value of eigenvalues of a matrix and $eigenvalues_{-T_1} = -eigenvalues_{T_1}$, we have that $\rho(-T_1) = \rho(T_1)$. Combine this with what we found in Problem 1(2), and we see that
\begin{equation*}
    \rho(D^{-1}(L + U)) = \rho(-T_1) = \rho(T_1) = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} > 1
\end{equation*}

As the standard convergence condition is not satisfied, we see that neither the Jacobi iterative method nor the Gauss-Seidel iterative method will converge.
